# Wind Monitoring

Forecasting wind speed have a lot of benefits, like manage the power transmission and distribution grid, protect the equipaments from over production, 
doing th maintenance in a good moment, etc. 
With that in mind, this project was developed to create a interface to expose the predictions data based in previous data.<br>
To develop this project, an docker image was created for each statistical model used and another to expose the data in a dashboard.
To orchastarte the containers, docker compose was used. 
The database was created locally to store the models parameters, wind speed data and turbine locations.
A test database filled with 10% of nan's in random locations was created to test the model used to fill the nan's.<br><br>

## Kriging

Also named gaussian process regression, kriging is a method to make some predictions in space. This method was used to predict missing data.
The method uses a covariance function to describe how the values are distributed. Kriging method assumes that the values in a field are centered
in a mean value. The model used in this project is the ordinary krigin, that assumes a constant mean value. All data from a turbine was deleted
to test the method. 
For that case, **the score of the method is almost 0.99**, and a graph with the real values and predicted values is shown below (turbine #6):
